# Using Machine Learning to Classification EEG Signals 
Training a classifier to separate EO and EC conditions from training samples and identifying labels for test samples.


This notebook presents the design of a machine learning-based classifier for the differentiation between eypes-open and eyes-close using features extracted from electroencephalograph(EEG) signals.After the EEG signals are preprocessed and feature extraction, four machine learning algorithm (KNN, Naive Bayes model, LG and SVM) are chosen to be applied for classification.
